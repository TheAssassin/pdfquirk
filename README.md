pdfquirk is a little utility to create PDFs out of images on the 
harddisk or from the scanner.

It uses the reliable and widely available tools convert from Imagemagick 
and scanimage from the SANE project, the standard scan solution under
Linux.

pdfquirk is still at a very early stage, but already useful. 
Contributions are very welcome.
